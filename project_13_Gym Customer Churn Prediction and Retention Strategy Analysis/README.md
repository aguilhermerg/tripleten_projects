# Gym Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategy Analysis

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in the Model Fitness gym chain by leveraging data analytics. The goals include:
- Predicting the probability of customer churn for the following month.
- Creating customer profiles to identify distinct groups and their characteristics.
- Analyzing key factors influencing churn.
- Developing actionable recommendations to improve customer retention, including targeted strategies and service enhancements.

## Results
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 4,000 gym members, identifying trends such as higher churn rates among newer members, non-partner clients, and those who do not participate in group classes.
- **Modeling**: Implemented machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict churn probabilities.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified distinct customer profiles prone to churn, such as short-term contract holders and non-participants in promotional activities.
- **Recommendations**: Proposed targeted retention strategies, including personalized engagement for high-risk groups and service improvements like extended contract incentives.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, clustering)
  - SciPy (hierarchical clustering)
- **Data Source**: `gym_churn_us.csv` containing 14 features related to customer behavior and demographics.

## Skills/Competencies Acquired
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed data, including handling categorical variables and standardizing features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified patterns and correlations in customer behavior.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and evaluated predictive models for churn classification.
- **Clustering**: Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering to segment customers.
- **Business Insights**: Translated analytical findings into actionable business strategies.

## Potential Improvements
1. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional variables like customer feedback or class attendance history to enhance model accuracy.
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Expand the dataset to include time-series trends for better churn prediction.
3. **Advanced Modeling**: Experiment with ensemble methods or neural networks to improve predictive performance.
4. **Real-Time Implementation**: Develop a dashboard for real-time churn monitoring and intervention.
5. **A/B Testing**: Validate retention strategies (e.g., targeted promotions) through controlled experiments.
