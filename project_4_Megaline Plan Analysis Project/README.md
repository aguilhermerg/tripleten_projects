# Megaline Plan Analysis Project

## 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the behavior of customers subscribed to two different mobile plans, Surf and Ultimate, offered by the telecom company Megaline. The goal is to determine which plan generates more revenue, helping the company adjust its advertising budget accordingly. The analysis involves examining customer usage data (calls, messages, and internet traffic) from 500 customers in 2018.

## 2. Result
- **Revenue Comparison**: The Ultimate plan generates higher revenue on average compared to the Surf plan, primarily due to its higher monthly fee and additional included services.
- **Usage Patterns**: Customers on the Surf plan tend to exceed their included limits more frequently, incurring extra charges, whereas Ultimate plan users generally stay within their limits.
- **Behavioral Insights**: The analysis revealed that call durations and message counts are relatively consistent between the two plans, but internet usage varies significantly, with Surf plan users consuming more data beyond their included limits.

## 3. Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `pyplot` for data visualization.
  - `scipy` for statistical analysis.
- **Data Handling**: 
  - Loading and merging multiple datasets (`users`, `calls`, `messages`, `internet`, `plans`).
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, correcting data types, enriching data).
- **Visualization**: 
  - Bar charts to compare average call durations between plans.
  - Pivot tables for aggregating and summarizing data.

## 4. What You Learned (Skills/Competencies Acquired)
- **Data Analysis**: Gained experience in analyzing customer behavior and revenue patterns using real-world datasets.
- **Data Cleaning**: Learned techniques to handle missing data, correct data types, and enrich datasets for analysis.
- **Statistical Methods**: Applied statistical tests to validate hypotheses about plan performance.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developed the ability to translate business questions into data-driven analyses.

## 5. Are There Improvements to Be Made?
- **Data Scope**: The analysis is based on a limited sample of 500 customers. Expanding the dataset could provide more robust insights.
- **Time Frame**: The data covers only one year (2018). Including multiple years could reveal trends and seasonal variations.
- **Additional Metrics**: Incorporating customer demographics or geographic data might uncover deeper behavioral patterns.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Using machine learning models to predict customer churn or upsell opportunities could enhance the analysis.
- **User Segmentation**: Segmenting customers based on usage patterns could help tailor marketing strategies more effectively.
