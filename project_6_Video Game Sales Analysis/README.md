# Video Game Sales Analysis: Identifying Success Patterns  

## 1. Project Objective  
The objective of this project is to analyze historical sales data of video games across different platforms, genres, and regions to identify patterns that determine a game's success. The insights gained will help the online store **Ice** plan effective advertising campaigns by understanding what factors contribute to a game's popularity and commercial success.  

## 2. Result  
Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the video game sales dataset, several key insights were uncovered:  

- The number of game releases peaked around **2008-2009** (approximately **1,400 games**) before declining to around **600 games annually post-2012**.  
- The **top platforms by total sales** were identified, with **PS2 leading historically**.  
- **Sales trends** were analyzed by year and platform, revealing how different platforms performed over time.  
- **Data quality issues** were addressed through cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardizing column names.  
- **Key metrics** like total sales (sum of regional sales) were calculated to better understand game performance.  

## 3. Tools Used  
- **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation)  
- **Data visualization libraries** (`plotly.express`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)  
- **Statistical analysis** (`scipy.stats`)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  
- **Markdown** for documentation

## 5. Potential Improvements  
ðŸ”¹ **Incorporate more recent data** beyond 2016 for current market trends  
ðŸ”¹ **Deeper analysis of regional sales differences** (NA, EU, JP, Other)  
ðŸ”¹ **More sophisticated success metrics** (including critic/user scores)  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine learning modeling** to predict game success  
ðŸ”¹ **Sentiment analysis of reviews** to complement sales data  
ðŸ”¹ **Analysis of pricing strategies** and their impact on sales  
ðŸ”¹ **More detailed genre analysis** to identify emerging trends
