# A/B Testing and Hypothesis Prioritization for E-commerce Revenue Optimization

## 1. Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze and prioritize marketing hypotheses aimed at increasing revenue for a large online store. The project involved:
- Prioritizing a list of hypotheses using frameworks like ICE and RICE.
- Conducting an A/B test to evaluate the impact of changes on key metrics such as conversion rates, average order value, and revenue.
- Cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure accurate analysis.
- Visualizing results to draw actionable insights for business decisions.

## 2. Result
- **Hypothesis Prioritization**: Using the ICE and RICE frameworks, hypotheses were ranked based on reach, impact, confidence, and effort. The top hypotheses identified were related to promotional strategies, subscription forms, and product recommendations.
- **A/B Testing**: The A/B test revealed significant differences in key metrics between the control (Group A) and test (Group B) groups. The results were visualized to show cumulative revenue, conversion rates, and other critical metrics over time.
- **Data Insights**: The analysis highlighted the importance of focusing on high-impact hypotheses and validated the effectiveness of certain marketing strategies through testing.

## 3. Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy.
- **Data Handling**: Data cleaning, aggregation, and preprocessing.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-value calculations.
- **Visualization**: Line plots, box plots, and other graphical representations to illustrate trends and comparisons.
- **Frameworks**: ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) for hypothesis prioritization.

## 4. What You Learned
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, corrected data formats, and ensured consistency for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualizations and statistical methods to explore data distributions and relationships.
- **Hypothesis Prioritization**: Applied ICE and RICE frameworks to evaluate and rank marketing hypotheses effectively.
- **A/B Testing**: Designed and analyzed A/B tests to measure the impact of changes on business metrics.
- **Statistical Methods**: Used statistical tests to validate results and ensure reliability.
- **Visualization Skills**: Created clear and informative plots to communicate findings.

## 5. Improvements to Be Made
- **Larger Sample Size**: Increasing the sample size for the A/B test could provide more robust and generalizable results.
- **Extended Test Duration**: Running the test for a longer period might capture more variations in user behavior.
- **Additional Metrics**: Including metrics like customer retention and long-term revenue impact could offer deeper insights.
- **Automation**: Automating the hypothesis prioritization process could save time and reduce manual errors.
- **Segmented Analysis**: Breaking down results by user segments (e.g., new vs. returning customers) could reveal more nuanced insights.
