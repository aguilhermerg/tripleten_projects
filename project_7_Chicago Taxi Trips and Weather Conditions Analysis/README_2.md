# Exploratory Data Analysis of Zuber Ride-Sharing Service in Chicago

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze data from Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, to uncover patterns in passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on ride frequency. The analysis involved working with a database to test hypotheses about how weather conditions might influence ride frequency. The goal was to provide actionable insights to help Zuber optimize its services and improve user experience.

## Results
- **Data Exploration**: The project involved loading and exploring two datasets: `df_trips_amount` (containing company names and trip amounts) and `df_drop_locations` (containing drop-off locations and average trips).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - The top companies by trip volume were identified (e.g., Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services).  
  - The most frequent drop-off locations (e.g., Loop, River North) were analyzed to understand passenger preferences.  
  - No immediate data quality issues were detected during the initial exploration.  
- **Visualization**: The project used Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.  
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.  
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.  
  - `scipy` for statistical analysis.  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - `project_sql_result_01.csv`: Trip data by company.  
  - `project_sql_result_04.csv`: Drop-off location data.  

## Skills/Competencies Acquired
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Learned to handle and preprocess datasets for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained experience in identifying patterns and trends in ride-sharing data.  
- **Data Visualization**: Improved skills in creating visualizations to communicate findings effectively.  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Explored the impact of external factors (e.g., weather) on ride frequency.  

## Potential Improvements
1. **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate additional datasets (e.g., weather data, time-of-day trends) to deepen the analysis.  
2. **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Use more sophisticated statistical methods to validate hypotheses.  
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Implement tools like `Plotly` for interactive dashboards to enhance data storytelling.  
4. **Automation**: Develop scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as data loading and cleaning, for scalability.  

This project provided valuable insights into ride-sharing trends in Chicago and highlighted opportunities for further analysis to support Zuber's growth and operational efficiency.
