# Market Analysis of Los Angeles Restaurants for a Robot-Waiter Cafe Venture

## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive market analysis of restaurants in Los Angeles to evaluate the feasibility and potential success of opening a small cafeteria with robot waiters. The analysis aimed to provide insights into current market conditions, competition, customer preferences, and operational strategies to attract investors and ensure long-term sustainability.

## Results
- **Market Composition**: The majority of establishments in Los Angeles are restaurants (75.2%), followed by fast food (11%), cafes (4.5%), pizza places (3.3%), bars (3%), and bakeries (2.9%).
- **Chain vs. Independent**: 61.9% of establishments are non-chain (independent), while 38.1% are part of chains.
- **Seating Capacity**: No significant difference in seating capacity was found between chain and non-chain establishments.
- **Popular Areas**: The top streets with the highest concentration of restaurants were identified, along with insights into seating distributions and establishment types in these areas.
- **Key Insights**: The data revealed opportunities for differentiation, such as focusing on unique customer experiences (e.g., robot waiters) and targeting underserved locations.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and presenting the analysis.

## Skills/Competencies Acquired
